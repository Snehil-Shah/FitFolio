Mandatory Pre-requisites before utilizing the backend of Fitfolio:

-> Make sure there exists a MySQL user with the following credentials on your machine:
   username: "root"
   server: "localhost"
   password: "password"
-> If this is the first time you are running this backend in your machine, run "database_init.sql": This creates the database named "fitfolio" with the necessary tables inside.

Running the Website: Make sure you run the website on a server with PHP installed. That can be Apache or anything else.
Strong recommendation: Install the VSCode extension called "PHP Server" and then in its extension settings set the path of the PHP executable to the file "php.exe" that is installed inside the XAMPP folder.
